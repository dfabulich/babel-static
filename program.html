<h2>The Babel Software Suite</h2>
<p>This is <b>babel</b>, the Treaty of Babel analysis tool.
Babel performs all the fundamental operations for dealing with
the features offered by the treaty, and serves as a flexible
multi-tool for analyzing and working with treaty-compliant files.</p>
<p>Namely, babel:</p>
<ul>
<li>extracts metadata from story files
<li>extracts cover art from story files
<li>determines the format of a story file
<li>determines the IFID of a story file
<li>verifies the correctness of iFiction metadata
<li>bundles story files, metadata, and cover art together in the blorb format
</ul>

<p>Babel is also a portable C API for accessing the functionality provided by
the treaty.</p>
<p>Included with the babel source is a suite of programs intended to extend
babel's functionality and help users start taking advantage of the benefits
provided by the treaty.</p>
<p>The babel suite includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>babel-get: Fetches metadata and cover art from a variety of sources
<li>babel-list: Demo program to describe all story files in a directory
<li>ifiction-aggregate: Combine multiple iFiction files into one
<li>ifiction-xtract: Search metadata for a named value
<li>babel-cache.pl: Build a cache of metadata and cover art for your story file collection
<li>babel-marry.pl: Encapsulate your story collection with its metadata
<li>simple-marry: Simplified babel-marry for windows users
<li>babel-wed.pl: Find and merge a story file with its metadata (also available as windows executable)
</ul>

<p>Some of babel-get's functionality requires cURL, the command-line url tool,
which can be obtained at <a href="https://curl.se/">https://curl.se/</a>.
